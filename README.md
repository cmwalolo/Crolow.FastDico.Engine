The current library uses extensively interfaces as models and services, most of them are not implemented in this library. To build an application using this library, you need first to implement the missing objects which will ne most likely dependant of your data layers. 

This code is totally written by my own, and it is free for strictly personal use.
There is no free support on any piece of code.
